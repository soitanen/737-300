TODO list:
-------------

Short perspective:
- check coordinates of passanger and cargo payload places
- make correct thrust for different altitudes and speed
Medium perspective:
- work on FMC
- hydraulics system
- electrical system
Things, that I can't do due to my skill:
- new 3D cockpit. Target - PMDG level :)
